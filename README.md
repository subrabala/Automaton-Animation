# Automaton Animation

This project demonstrates cellular automaton animation based on a user-defined rule. The user can enter a rule number, and the application generates a pattern based on that rule. The cellular automaton follows the "Elementary Cellular Automaton" concept, where each cell's state is determined by its neighboring cells.

## How to Use
1. Enter a rule number in the input field.
2. Click the "Generate Pattern" button to create the animation.
3. The animation will be displayed in the grid container below.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap 5.1.3)
- JavaScript

## About Cellular Automaton
Cellular automaton is a discrete model that consists of a grid of cells, each having a finite number of states. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of predefined rules. In this project, the "Elementary Cellular Automaton" rule is used, which determines the state of each cell based on its neighboring cells.
