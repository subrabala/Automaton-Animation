# Automaton Animation

This project demonstrates cellular automaton animation based on a user-defined rule. The user can enter a rule number, and the application generates a pattern based on that rule. The cellular automaton follows the "Elementary Cellular Automaton" concept, where each cell's state is determined by its neighboring cells.

## How to Use
1. Enter a rule number in the input field.
2. Click the "Generate Pattern" button to create the animation.
3. The animation will be displayed in the grid container below.
4. Toggle the "Explore the Dark Side" switch to switch between black and white cell colors.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap 5.1.3)
- JavaScript

## About Cellular Automaton
Cellular automaton is a discrete model that consists of a grid of cells, each having a finite number of states. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of predefined rules. In this project, the "Elementary Cellular Automaton" rule is used, which determines the state of each cell based on its neighboring cells.

## Credits
This project uses the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout. The animation logic is implemented using JavaScript.
